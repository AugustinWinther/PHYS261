# PHYS261
Collection of code snippets I've created during the course [PHYS261 Applied Quantum Physics](https://www4.uib.no/en/studies/courses/phys261) at the University of Bergen.

**Exercise 1:** Approximation of Harmonic Oscillator eigenenergies via Infinite Square Well eigenfunctions.

**Exercise 2:** Plotting of Radial Wave Function.
